Senior Automation Engineer Take-Home Assessment

Objective

Automate complex end-to-end workflows using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) against a real application. We want to assess your ability to:

- Handle multiple UI states and flows
- Use advanced Playwright techniques (parallel tests, fixtures, intercepts)
- Structure code with Page Object Model (POM)
- Assert on UI + network behavior

Time Estimate

2â€“4 hours. Please dont spend significantly more than that.

Instructions

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Complete the tasks below.
3. Push your code and create a pull request to your forked repo.
4. Notify us when done.

Tasks

Use this application: [todos](https://todomvc.com/examples/typescript-react/)

Scenarios to automate:

1. End-to-End Task Workflow
   - Add 2 tasks (e.g., "Learn Playwright", "Write tests")
   - Mark the first task as completed
   - Edit the second task to change its name
   - Delete one of the tasks

2. State Validation
   - Use filter tabs (All, Active, Completed) to verify task states
   - Ensure completed items show only under "Completed"
   - Ensure active items show only under "Active"

3. Advanced Techniques
   - Use Page Object Model to organize task interactions
   - Add network request assertions using `page.waitForResponse`
   - Simulate time manipulation to mock due-date-style behavior

4. Bonus
   - Use multiple browser contexts to simulate two users
   - Run tests in parallel with isolated fixtures
   - Add accessibility checks (e.g., `axe-core`)
   - Use GitHub Actions workflow to run the test

Tech Constraints

- Use Playwright with TypeScript
- Tests must run via `npx playwright test`

Evaluation Criteria

- Correctness of test cases and assertions
- Quality of structure and reuse (Page Object Model, fixtures)
- Effective use of Playwright's APIs (waits, context, intercepts)
- Git hygiene (branching, commits)
- Documentation and clarity
